# Development Notes

## Architecture Decisions

**State Management**: I chose React Context over Redux for this application to keep the implementation simple and focused. React Context provides sufficient state management capabilities for this scope, with centralized product data, filters, and error handling. For a production application with more complex state requirements, multiple teams, or extensive middleware needs, Redux would be the preferred choice.

**Component Architecture**: The application follows a modular component structure with clear separation of concerns. Each component has a single responsibility, making the codebase more maintainable and testable. Key architectural patterns include:
- Context-based state management eliminating prop drilling
- Reusable UI components (Pagination, SearchBar, StatusDropdown, etc.)
- Custom hooks for data fetching and state management
- Centralized error handling and loading states

**Modularity**: Functions and components are designed with testing in mind, following the single responsibility principle. Each utility function, component, and hook can be tested independently, making the codebase more reliable and easier to debug.

**Performance Optimizations**: Implemented several performance enhancements including:
- Memoized expensive calculations (KPI computations, status calculations)
- Debounced search functionality to prevent excessive API calls
- URL-based state persistence for better user experience
- Efficient Apollo Client caching strategies

## Future Enhancements

**User Experience**: Given more development time, I would focus on enhancing the user experience with:
- Smooth animations and transitions for state changes
- Advanced filtering and sorting capabilities
- Bulk operations
- Export functionality for reports and data

**Technical Improvements**: Additional enhancements would include:
- Comprehensive test suite with unit and integration tests
- Add correct accessibility features to the site
